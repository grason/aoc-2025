My solutions for **[Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025)**.

## Overview

This repository contains my personal solutions to the 2025 edition of Advent of Code, written day-by-day as the puzzles are released. I use this event as an opportunity to have fun, experiment with new language features, and occasionally try something completely different from my day-to-day work.

## Language & Tools

Just for fun. I'm going to be writing the daily challenges in go.

Stars and war stories will be added as I survive each day.

## Repository structure
